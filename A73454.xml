            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Then my Lord bad me ≈øpeake, and I an≈øwered to foure prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal points, briefly in this manner.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, my very good Lords, wheras I am charged in myn Inditment, that I was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, it is very true; to God almightie I ≈øo was<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and I thinck lawfully might be. and as I remember, it is al≈øo allowed in your boke of common prayer, in the vi≈øitation of the ≈øick, that if anie man find hym≈øelf burdened in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, he should make his confe≈ø≈øion to the Mini≈øter.

Secondly wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I am charged, that I was reconciled from myn obedience to her Maie≈øtie, and to the Romish Religion: I wil depo≈øe the contrarie. For I was neuer reconciled from anie obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to my Prince, for I obey her ≈øtil<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> nor to aine Religion: for although I ≈øomtimes went to Church again≈øt my wil, yet was I neuer of anie other Religion, then the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,

Fourtly and la≈øtly I humbly be≈øech your good Lordships, as you wil an≈øwer it before God, to explicat the meaning of the ≈øtatute to the Iurie, if the meaning therof be, to make it trea≈øon, for a man fallen into the di≈øplea≈øure of God, through his ≈øinnes, to be reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ciled to God again by him, to whom God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the autoritie of reconciliation.

            <p>LIkewi≈øe at Lanca≈øter vvithin the ≈øame moneth, other tvvo Seminarie Prie≈øts, M. Robert Nutter, and M. Edvvard Thvving vvere condemned and put to death, for their Prie≈øthood. The elder of them M. Nutter, vvas one of tho≈øe Prie≈øts and pri≈øoners, which being brought by their kepers from their ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral pri≈øons, to the tovvre wharfe, in the yeare of our Lord, 1585. and there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to enter into a shippe, readie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided to carie them into banishment, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red publikly to the commi≈ø≈øioners, that they did not accept of that banishment, as of anie grace or mercie at al, for they had not committed anie fault, neither again≈øt their Quene nor countrie, as this pretended mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie fal≈øly pre≈øuppo≈øed; and therfore in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øe termes reque≈øted rather to be tried, and to an≈øvvere their accu≈øers at We≈øtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter, and at Tiburne, then to be thus caried again≈øt their vvills, out of their natiue Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, from their freinds, and neighboures vvhom they vvere to ≈øerue, according to their Prie≈øtlie functions. Affirming moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that though perforce they vvere caried avvay, yet they vvould a≈ø≈øuredly returne
<pb facs="tcp:150527:48"/> to the ≈øame worke, ≈øo ≈øoone as God, and their ≈øpiritual Superiors, would permit them ≈øo to doe. As this ble≈ø≈øed Martyr for his part, and diuer≈øe others haue wel and mo≈øt happely performed. M. Thwing was no le≈ø≈øe re≈øolued in this glorious quarel, as wel appeared both by his life and death, and particularly by his godlie letters, to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ≈øi≈øter, and others, which may be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in a larger relation. Only here for a ta≈øte of his ≈øwete and zealous good ≈øpirit, I shal recite part of two letters written by him in pri≈øon, vnto me that write this. In the former of which, he congratulateth with his friends, his owne impri≈øonment, in the≈øe words: <q>My ≈øelfe am now pri≈øoner for Chri≈øt, in Lanca≈øter Ca≈øtle, expecting nothing but execution, at the next A≈ø≈øi≈øes. I de≈øire you to commend me to the deuout praiers of my freinds with you, that by their help, I may con≈øummat my cour≈øe to Gods glorie, and the good of my countrie.

            </p>
            <p>His other letter written but few daies before his martyrdom with like con≈øolation of his expected good end, he concludeth thus: <q>This day the Iudges come to Lanca≈øter, where I am in expectation of a happie death, if it ≈øo plea≈øe God almightie.
